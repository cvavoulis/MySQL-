## MySQL-

I used MySQL workbench to manipulate data from the Sakila database. 

The queries I performed tested my ability to select using aggregate functions, joins (both inner and left), subqueries, and aliases. We also were asked to update and alter table data, consult table schemas, and create views.

# Prerequisites
Queries were made on the Sakila sample database and were run in MySQLWorkbench.
